# Plant-Hare-Lynx
This is an assignemnt for the skill course Bioinformatics Skills (2223-SKI2102) at Maastricht University by Carolina Bustillos and Konstantin Waldek.
It will consdier several population model based on three species.


**TASK 1. Describe in your own words (max 300 words) the model and model parameters: How do the populations of the three species change in the model? What do the parameters represent? Add some documentation to the Matlab file of the model. Check section 5.1 in the Modeling Life bookLinks to an external site. on three-species models.

The model describes a 3-species food chain model: a plant, a hare and a lyns. For the herbivore and predator, we assume that the per capita birth rate is proportional to the amount of food consumed (for both hervivores and carnivores) and that the per capita death rate is a constant. These are parameters that can be modified. The dynamic of these interactions can be mathematically represented as following: 
dydt(1) = y(1)*(1-y(1)) - ((a1*y(1))/(1+b1*y(1)))*y(2); 
dydt(2) = ((a1*y(1))/(1+b1*y(1)))*y(2)-d1*y(2)-(a2*y(2)/(1+b2*y(2)))*y(3);
dydt(3) = (a2*y(2)/(1+b2*y(2)))*y(3) - d2*y(3);
Were, y(1)= plant mass, y(2)=number of hares, y(3)=number of herbivores. To have a notion of how the population changes due to natural factors, the following represent the modifiable parameters
br/
a1 = how quickly plants gets eaten
b1 = growth rate of plants
a2 = how quickly hare gets eaten
b2 = birth rate of hares
d1 = per capita death rate of hare(hervivore)
d2 = per capita death rate of carnivore (lynw)
In natural systems, there are always variables that fluctuate due to predation, weather, disturbances, etc, reason why this parametes can be change to simulate and mimic what realistically happen 

**Description of scenarios

SCENARIO 1




SCENARIO 2



SCENARIO 3
For scenario 3 there is a peak for all the species at first, but mostly for the Hares population. Over time, the lynx population decreases exponentatially, reaching 0 individuals by the 30th month. Meanwhile, the Hare and the plants population oscilates in a steady state until decreasing in an horizontal asymptote(for Hares around 0.3 and for plants around 0.06) while slowly decreasing. However, the Hare populations always remains higher thant those of the plants. This model was achieved by decreasing the death rate of the lynx but also decreasing the death rate of the hares. A reason why the Hare population didn't go to extinction while the Lynx population did when decreasing both death rates might be due to Hares bigger resilience to disturbances. For instance if there is a catastrophy, maybe is easier for the Hares to reproduce again because of the high amount of offsprings that we have. On the other hand, the Steady space graph begins first with a high population of lyns and hares (z=lyns, y=hares and x=plants). Over time, the population of plants and lyns decreases in a faster rate than the hares population. When the lyns populations is really close to zero, both the hares and plant population begin to oscilate in the state space, having every time a smaller period, forming a sort of spiral. This is due to their steady state decrease in the number of individuals.
